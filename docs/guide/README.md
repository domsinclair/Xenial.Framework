# Introduction

**Xenial.Framework** is a set of powerful modules for the [DevExpress expressAppFramework (XAF)](https://www.devexpress.com/XAF).  
Handcrafted following 10 years experience with the framework, working with small applications to large scale systems with dozens of developers, Xeenial Framework will help you build robust, state of the art applications quickly and allow you to scale your future development efforts easily, without getting in your way.

The framework was designed to adhere to the following principles:

#### Easy

You don't need to learn any new concepts if you are already familiar with XAF, no matter what skill level you are at.

#### Flexible

You can use as much or as little of the framework as befits the requirements of the application upon which you are working.

#### Focused

The framework's featureset has been developed from experiences gained from the challenges that arise from developing Line of Business(LOB) applications.

## Key Concepts

Support is provided for both the [ModelEditor](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/112582/concepts/application-model/model-editor) and a code-centric approach to XAF development utilising all the basic primitives provided by XAF. Xenial provides a convention based framework that helps you and your team to create your own domain specific rules, resulting in more consistent applications with less need for extensive configuration.

::: tip
Xenial Framework actively encourages a multi faceted approach to problem solving and the use of the right tool for the job in hand.
